# IRCbot

Most of this is copied from elsewhere, such as:

 * Rosetta Code
 * Unity3D reference manual
 * A simple ircbot script I stumbled upon in google

It may be fun to try it. To test, write yourself a `config.json` with following format:

    {
        "server": "irc.ircnet.net",
        "port": 6667,
        "nick": "your_bot_name",
        "channel": "#your_channel"
    }
